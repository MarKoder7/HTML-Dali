My favorite 3 websites are 
1 



1. What is the first thing that draws your focus?

2. How many menu items are on the home page? How many submenu items for each one of those?

3. When searching for something specific, how easy or difficult is it? Pick something to search for such as a specific post that you remember from a friend if it is social media, a particular product on retail sites or a particular article. Count the number of mouse clicks before you arrive at what you are looking for.

4. List something you like about each site that you would like to learn how to emulate when you start creating your own sites. This can be an animation, user control, format, etc.
